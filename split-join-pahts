#Python Managing Files and Directories
#Python can used strings (binary or otherwise) to represent paths.
#os.path modules offers path related methods for creating and manipulating "paths as strings"
#os.path is one of the most widely used functionality. It gives the abiliy to split and join paths 
#There are 3 methods used to split paths:
  #1.0. split = os.path.split(cur_dir)
        e.g. 
      In [23]: os.path.split(cur_dir)
      Out[23]: ('/home', 'user1')

      #above we ca see that the current direct pathname /home/user1 has been split into strings ('/home', 'user1')

  #2.0. dirname = os.path.dirname(cur_dir)
      In [24]: os.path.dirname(cur_dir)
      Out[24]: '/home'

      #above we can see that eventhough our current directory is /home/user1 the os.path.dirname shows only the parent directory name '/home'

  #basename = os.path.basename(cur_dir)

    In [25]: os.path.basename(cur_dir)
    Out[25]: 'user1'
    
    #the above command is the converse of os.path.dirname = Parent Dir Name only. Where as os.path.basename = Shows only the leaf directory name not the complete path not even the parent directory name
